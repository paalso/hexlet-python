2734,France,"Lifted notes of dried pear, dried chamomile flowers and dried lemon peel have a strong impact. The palate comes in with lovely generous sweetness that amplifies that chamomile-tisane notion and boosts the dried-fruit notes. Against the distinctly medium-sweet fruitiness stands a clarion line of acidity. The evolution of fruit flavors weaves a colorful tapestry of aromas. This is carefully balanced and quietly intense. It holds immense strength at its core that radiates flavor and fruit. Made from a field blend of Alsace varieties, each adds something: aroma, texture, freshness and body. The finish is endless and very fruity. Have this with cheese or a subtle dessert.

The medium-sweet palate impresses with both fresh and dried notes of fruit: plum, white sultana, white currant and the ripest pear and apple you can imagine. This is full-on and big but balanced by tingling, fresh and precise acidity. A field blend of polar opposites, Riesling and Gewurztraminer, this unites their virtues of aromatic textured richness and poised finesse. Again, this is not a wine that is easily categorized with its medium-sweet, soil- and fruit-driven profile, but it is a joy to experience and savor. The finish lasts and lasts.

2740,France,"A lovely touch of flint and smoke carry a touch of residual reduction. Underneath that is lemony purity. The palate adds a touch of stone fruit, a touch of ripe mirabelle plum—its generosity only underlined by the taut lemon freshness that pervades the wine. There is something stern and stony at the core, something fundamental and profound. The body is precise, dry and powerful and incredibly moreish. This is lip smacking but has not even started to show itself properly. The finish is clean, stony and lasting. This is one to keep.

Drink from 2025.,,95,250.0,Bordeaux,Pomerol,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Trotanoy			
2743,France,"There is something heady about this: a hint of chamomile tincture and pure lemon zest. The palate cuts in with uncompromising purity and zestiness—this really wants to showcase pure stone and tart citrus. There are glimpses, however, of plump ripe mirabelle plums and a touch of dried pear and quince. Nonetheless, this is governed by stern tanginess and thus is for real adults only. This is dry, slender and shows absolute focus. A celebration of stone and Riesling.

The length is astonishing and dreamy. This is dangerously delicious.",Grand Cru Pfersigberg Doux,95,90.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Domaine Barmès-Buecher			
2746,France,"After a touch of funky reduction, beautiful hints of herbs appear: yarrow and lemon balm play alongside lemon and crisp green-apple aromas. On the palate, these notions all remain taut along a very linear, slender but concentrated body that owes more to citrus than to apples. There is a powerful enduring core of fruit and stone that will make this last. The flavors echo long and leave the mouth totally clean.

While there is distinct residual sweetness on the palate, this has a counterweight in the rich texture of the midpalate. There is something authentic and deeply comforting and satisfying at the core of this wine that says Alsace.

4738,France,"This is a rich, soft wine with jammy black fruits and ripe tannins. The acidity will hold the wine together and allow it to age. A mineral edge comes from the caillou (stones) in the soil—hence the wine's name.

Drink this very ageworthy wine from 2023.",,93,34.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Estèphe,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Le Crock			
4756,France,"With swathes of delicious herbal and green Sauvignon Blanc fruit just delicately underpinned by the wood aging, this is a wine that is rich while remaining so crisp. It is the tangy grapefruit and crisp texture that will allow this wine to age. Drink from 2020.",Pavillon Blanc du Château Margaux,93,150.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Blanc,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Margaux			
4757,France,"The wine is powerful with fine tannins and concentrated black fruits. The dense texture is lifted by the acidity and beautiful fruit of the vintage.

4761,France,"The nose needs air but as it wakes up, subtle notes of fragrant baked peach rise. On the palate a streak of lemon freshness provides both frame and direction, alongside a lovely apple-skin texture. Made from a blend of Riesling, Pinot Gris and Gewürztraminer this unites the virtues of each variety. This is full of life and impresses with its great precision and freshness. The finish is bone dry. Lovely now but will age. Drink now through 2025.",Win.ck,93,27.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Alsace white blend,Clément Klur			
4762,France,"The intense aroma of very ripe peach rises from the glass. There are nuances of orange peel, too. These become aromatically amplified on the rich, dense and almost grippy palate. There is great concentration and residual sweetness, countered by bitter pith and texture. This is mature and totally fluid, ample and generous but its maturity adds subtle tone to the eloquent aromas. The finish is medium dry and very, very long.",Marckgrain Grand Cru,93,25.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Domaine Michel Fonne			
4763,France,"This wine clearly needs to breathe. It is only after a few minutes of airtime that it shows its true colors: then very tart and aromatic apples appear, alongside a hint of smoke and a sheer touch of lemon freshness.

4764,France,"There is a touch of smoke and stone that lends a darker aspect to the ripe but crisp apple fruit.

4765,France,"The gentlest floral hint is suggested on the nose. The palate, on the other hand, broods and does not want to let go of its flavors. The dry palate is stony, textured and clean but it does not yet let any fruit speak. There is real concentration and length, but it clearly is too early to enjoy this. The finish gives a suggestion of apple, but we had better wait. Drink 2020–2030.",Rosacker Grand Cru,93,35.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Biecher & Schaal

4794,Italy,"This opens with weedy aromas along with whiffs of coffee, espresso and toasted oak. The raw palate displays oak, licorice and dried sage but it lacks fruit richness. Astringent tannins generate an abrupt finish.",Mariondino,86,60.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Parusso			
4795,Italy,"This wine is dominated by aromas of oak, toast and espresso that carry over to the palate along with black cherry. Extremely astringent wood tannins cut the finish short and leave the mouth feeling dried.",Oro Canova Riserva,86,,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Ressia

It should be ready to drink by 2016.",,88,25.0,Bordeaux,Pessac-Léognan,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Baret			
4804,France,"This big and ripe wine hardly tastes like Bordeaux. That is until you get beneath the rich fruit and find the firmer tannins and the juicy black currant from Cabernet Sauvignon.

4833,France,"The ninth generation of the Dublois family goes for tight cropping on only 7.5 acres for Nectar (95% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon). Layers of wood dominate this wine. However, it does promise fruit as well, shown by the weight and richness. So it's a wine for a pause, to allow the intense spice and new wood flavors to die down.

4928,Italy,"A 50-50 blend of Merlot and Syrah, this easygoing wine opens with aromas of red currant, graphite and cracked peppercorn.

4929,Italy,"A 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of ripe plum, dark-skinned berry, cedar and purple flowers.

4931,Italy,"Bright berry and dark spice aromas waft out of the glass. A blend of Sangiovese and Syrah, the easy-drinking palate delivers blackberries, crushed raspberries and ground pepper alongside polished tannins. Drink soon.",Bacco in Toscana,87,18.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Guado al Melo			
4936,Spain,"Raspberry and red-plum aromas are floral and fresh, but simple. This has a hard, almost metallic mouthfeel and red-fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry. A wiry, short finish is raw and snappy in feel, with a hint of oak.",The Invisible Man,87,17.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Casa Rojo			
4937,Italy,"Made entirely of the Alpine grape Prié Blanc, planted in the highest vineyards in Europe, this vibrant sparkler opens with aromas of green apple, white spring flowers and a hint of resin. The palate offers ripe Bartlett pear, creamy Granny Smith and Alpine herb alongside brisk acidity and persistent bubbles.",Extra Brut Metodo Classico,87,28.0,Italy Other,Vino Spumante,,Prié Blanc,Cave du Vin Blanc de Morgex et de la Salle			
4944,Spain,"Red plum and currant aromas are a touch soupy but also suggestive of cherry Kool-Aid. This Garnacha-led blend is clacky and fairly acidic on the palate, but then it turns on itself to show raisin, loam and baked plum flavors. A lively finish gives it a boost out the door.",,87,20.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Cesca Vicent			
4945,Italy,"Made exclusively with Merlot, this opens with aromas of cedar, mint and dark berry. The straightforward palate offers dried black cherry, espresso and a hint of grilled bell pepper alongside somewhat raspy tannins that cut off the finish.",Pulleraia,87,40.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Merlot,Agricoltori del Chianti Geografico			
4947,Italy,"Made solely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of roasted coffee beans, toasted oak and blackberry jam. The warm, jammy palate offers black cherry extract, licorice, clove and black pepper alongside massively stringent tannins that leave the palate feeling roughed up and dry.",Suolo,87,165.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Sangiovese,Argiano			
4948,Italy,"Here's an easygoing blend of 70% Sangiovese and 30% Merlot that offers blue flowers and red berry aromas that carry over to the palate along with a hint of white pepper. Supple tannins support the bright, juicy flavors. Drink through 2016.",Borgaio,87,16.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Castello di Meleto			
4949,France,"For its youth, this is a rich, smooth wine. The tannins, even from the Malbec in the blend, are full, rounded and already integrated. Acidity and an attractive smokiness give this wine its already-drinkable character. Drink from the end of 2015.",Château la Bastide,87,15.0,Southwest France,Côtes du Marmandais,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Cave du Marmandais			
4950,Spain,"Rustic leathery aromas are capped and low on vibrant fruit scents. In the mouth, expect tannic scratchiness. Flavors of plum, cassis and toasty oak come across as mildly baked, while a narrow finish with notes of earth, loam and chocolate is solid. Drink now.",Reserva,88,29.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Marqués de Vitoria			
4951,Spain,"Raisin and prune aromas indicate full ripeness, while jammy fig notes come in later and confirm this wine's warm-vintage DNA. A clampy palate with big tannins offers inky flavors of plum and prune, while an oaky concentrated finish feels jammy. Drink through 2018.",Barranc Dels Closos,88,24.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Mas Igneus			
4955,France,"This is a blend from Aÿ on the Montagne de Reims and from the Côte des Blancs. It is intensely perfumed, with weight from Pinot Noir and crispness from Chardonnay. If it seems not quite integrated at this stage, it will hopefully come together over the next few years to reveal a ripe and rich wine. Drink from 2017.",Cuvée Paradoxe Premier Cru,88,55.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Pierre Gimonnet et Fils			
4956,Portugal,"As its name implies, the wine comes from chalky soil, giving this wine its mineral edge. The fruit is ripe and tropical in its generosity, full of yellow fruits, pineapple and mango. There is a fine floral aroma which, along with acidity, give the wine a bright aftertaste.",Quinto Elemento Reserva Chão Calcário,88,18.0,Tejo,,,Arinto,Quinta do Arrobe			
4960,Portugal,"This is a rich wine dominated by ripe Alicante Bouschet that gives some firm tannins as well as juicy red berry fruits. It is ripe, well balanced and likely to age well over the next few years. Drink from 2017.",Bátoreus Selection,88,16.0,Tejo,,,Portuguese Red,Terra Silvestre			
4961,Portugal,A ripe and warm wine full of yellow fruits and a full-bodied texture. It's rich and creamy with a fine balance between exotic fruit and the crispest citrus. The wine is ready to drink.,Terra d'Alter,88,14.0,Alentejano,,,Siria,Terras de Alter			
4964,Spain,"Leesy white fruit aromas open this blend of 80% Albariño with Loureiro and Treixadura. In the mouth, it's all citric acidity and stoniness. The body doesn't register. Flavors of blood orange and lemon are also minerally, while the finish is persistently linear.",O Rosal Davila,88,20.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,White Blend,Valmiñor			
4967,Spain,"Leathery stalky berry aromas come across as being baked and rough. This is full and grabby on the palate with cooked blackberry and prune flavors that end dark, and spicy with notes of licorice and herbs.",,88,23.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Los 800			
4968,Italy,"Aromas of baked plum, spirits, baking spice and a whiff of blue flower lead the nose on this robust wine.

You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on the finish.",,88,45.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Giacomo Grimaldi			
4969,Spain,"Despite opening with a yellow color and waxy oily peach aromas, this benefits from zesty lemon-like acidity. Flavors of quince and apple are oaky, while effusive acidity keeps this Verdejo fresh on the finish, which is otherwise big and full. Drink now.",Parcela 52,88,20.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Verdejo,Finca Constancia			
4970,Italy,"Aromas of black cherries marinated in spirits, menthol, leather and chopped herbs lead the nose on this brawny wine. The hefty palate shows the heat of the vintage, offering dried berries, licorice, tobacco and mocha alongside the warmth of evident alcohol and jarring tannins. Give it a few years to let the tannins soften up a bit but then drink before the fruit dries up.",Monvigliero,88,65.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Sordo			
4971,France,The chalk subsoil of the Bélingard estate gives this wine its textured character. The wood aging smoothes out the crisp acidity of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon and adds a light layer of toast. It is still a young wine and will be better from late 2016 or even 2017.,Réserve,88,13.0,Southwest France,Bergerac Sec,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Bélingard			
4972,Italy,"Fresh and savory, this opens with aromas of dark berry, ground cooking spice and whiff of chopped herb. The vibrant palate doles out juicy black cherry, clove, star anise and blood orange accompanied by racy acidity.",,88,20.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Comm. G. B. Burlotto

4974,Italy,"This opens with rather funky aromas of scorched earth, overripe black-skinned fruit and a whiff of barnyard. The extracted palate offers mature black cherry, toast, espresso and a gamey note alongside tightly packed tannins. A note of roasted coffee bean signals the close.",Arborina La Foia,88,90.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Curto Marco

4977,France,"From vines planted to the west of Chablis, this is a soft, ripe and fruity wine. It has some tension from the minerality while keeping the white fruit flavors to the fore. Drink now or, better, from late 2016.",,88,19.0,Burgundy,Bourgogne Côtes d’Auxerre,,Chardonnay,Domaine Céline et Frédéric Gueguen			
4978,France,"Made from old vines, this ripe and concentrated wine is smooth and creamy. Good acidity balances the rich fruits, giving flavors of apples, pears and apricots cut by a line of citrus. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2017.",Les Grands Vignes,88,30.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Domaine Chenevières			
4980,France,"This is a tough wine, packed more with tannins than fruit. A bitter chocolate character comes from over-extraction of the tannins. The fruit is slow in coming, although there are hints of juiciness. Give it until 2017.",,84,15.0,Bordeaux,Haut-Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Fonsèche			
4981,France,"The 56 acres of this estate are in the heart of the Entre deux Mers region. This young and fruity wine has stalky black currant fruits and fresh acidity. There's a light touch of spicy wood and a crisp, red fruit aftertaste.",,84,16.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Guillebot Plaisance			
4982,France,This lean wine lacks fruit to support the dry tannins. That probably comes from the extraction that has also caused some bitterness. It's a hard wine that needs time to soften.,,84,18.0,Bordeaux,Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Leboscq			
4983,France,"From one of two properties in Listrac owned by the Thomas family (the other is Reverdi), this is seriously dark and tannic, with flavors of bitter chocolate extract and wood. It doesn't feel as if it will really soften enough.",,84,28.0,Bordeaux,Listrac-Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château L'Ermitage			
4989,France,"The gravel soils of the 51-acre vineyard gives this wine its firm character as well as bringing out the fruitiness. While the wood-aging flavors are still strong, this will soften and round out soon for a fresh, fruity wine.",,84,,Bordeaux,Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Tour Castillon			
4997,Spain,"Simple cherry and plum aromas lead to a modest palate with little substance to it. Short bursts of red-fruit flavors are as basic as can be, while the finish is hollow but raw in feel.",Tempranillo-Garnacha-Syrah,84,9.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Red Blend,Las Valles
